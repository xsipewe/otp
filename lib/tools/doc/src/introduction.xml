    <title>Scope</title>
    <p>The <c>Tools</c> application contains the following standalone
      tools, which are useful when developing Erlang programs:</p>
    <list type="bulleted">
      <item><p>Cover - A coverage analysis tool for Erlang.</p></item>
      <item><p>Profiling tools:</p>
        <list type="bulleted">
          <item><p>Cprof - Measures how many times each function is called.
            Uses a kind of local call trace breakpoints containing counters
            to achieve very low runtime performance degradation.</p></item>
          <item><p>Eprof - Measures how time is used in Erlang programs. It
            is a predecessor of Fprof.</p></item>
          <item><p>Fprof - Measures how time is used in Erlang programs.
             Uses trace to file to minimize runtime performance impact, and
             displays time for calling and called functions.</p></item>
        </list>
      </item>
      <item><p>Emacs - A package with <c>erlang.el</c> and
        <c>erlang-start.el</c> that provides support for Erlang in Emacs.
        Provides an editing mode with many bells and whistles, compilation
        support, and allows the user to start Erlang shells that run inside
        Emacs.</p></item>
      <item><p>Instrument - Utility functions for obtaining and analyzing
        resource use in an instrumented Erlang runtime system.</p></item>
      <item><p>Lcnt - A lock profiling tool for the Erlang runtime
        system.</p></item>
      <item><p>Make - A make utility for Erlang similar to UNIX Make.</p></item>
      <item><p>Tags - A tool for generating Emacs <c>TAGS</c> files from
        Erlang source files.</p></item>
      <item><p>Xref - A cross reference tool that can be used to check
        dependencies between functions, modules, applications, and
        releases.</p></item>
    </list>
    <p>Information about the tools Instrument, Make, and Tags is provided
      in the Reference Manual only.</p>
